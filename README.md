"Yeeh doh" is how my two-year-old says "let's go."

This game is for him, and for the small, funny things he loves.

## What it is

Yeeh Doh!! is a small, quiet island you can explore.  
There are trees, palms, flowers, rocks, and waves.  

Walk around. Go underwater. Listen to the music and the sea. Or spam the spacebar like my kid and see whether your GPU or CPU dies first. (Probably CPU).

## How to Play

1. Open the game.  
2. You’ll see the "Yeeh Doh!!" splash screen.  
3. Click anywhere.
4. You're at a random island.

That’s it. There are no menus or goals. Just explore.

## Planting

You can add new plants anywhere on the island.

- Click on the ground to grow a plant at that spot.  
  The game raycasts through anything under your cursor and places it on the island surface.  
- Different areas produce different plants depending on local “fertility.”  
- Underwater clicks are ignored.

Tip: try the shoreline, the hills, and the higher rocks. The mix changes with the terrain.

## The Name

“Yeeh doh” is what my son says when it’s time to go outside.  
This is about that same feeling: simple excitement, going somewhere new, just because it’s fun.
